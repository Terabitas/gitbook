As mentioned previously `nildev` will allow you to write code that is essence of your API endpoint. Everything else will be handled for you. This way you will have a working solution much sooner and afterwards you can dive deeper in to details.

# How should I read this documentation ?

As stated above `nildev` is all about making us more productive. This applies to documentation as well, so ideally you should not be spending tons of time reading through all those docs. 

Suggested TOC here is created according feedback we receive from you. If you think that something is missing please feel free to issue pull request [here](https://github.com/nildev/gitbook).
