# About

# Why we exist ?

We all have ideas that we want to put out there to see if any of those works. And we are not satisfied how much we can achieve in 24 hours. We want to run faster.
We want to produce and move from Minimal Viable Product to Minimal Marketable Product 2x times faster. And if idea takes off we want to be able to scale right off.

# How we do that ?

We provide a platform where we can share and reuse services required to build our ideas. 

We provide platform and frameworks which absorbs integration complexity between services. At the same time it allow us to focus on defining and implementing actual APIs.

We enable front-end developers to build applications with minimal back-end developer intervention. 

We provide tools which allow us to write code that is unique to our idea and the rest we can generate.

We open source everything to get more feedback from community and in this way improve where needed.


# What we build ?

**nildev.io** community which provides required tools, frameworks and services.
